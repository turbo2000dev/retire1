## PHASE 16: Events - Firebase Integration

**Goal:** Events saved to Firestore with complex type handling

### Tasks:
1. **Create event DTOs:**
   - [x] Not needed - Freezed handles JSON serialization automatically
   - [x] Event and EventTiming models already have toJson/fromJson

2. **Create event repository:**
   - [x] Create `lib/features/events/data/event_repository.dart`
   - [x] Implement CRUD for events
   - [x] Store in `projects/{projectId}/events` collection
   - [x] Handle complex type serialization with Freezed

3. **Update events provider:**
   - [x] Load events from Firestore
   - [x] Real-time updates with stream subscription
   - [x] Save changes to Firestore
   - [x] Keep sorting logic in sortedEventsProvider

4. **Update Assets & Events screen:**
   - [x] Handle async state for events (loading, error, data)
   - [x] Add error handling with try-catch blocks
   - [x] Show loading indicators and error states with retry

**Manual Test Checklist:**
- Ready for testing: Add events, saved to Firestore correctly
- Ready for testing: All timing types persist correctly
- Ready for testing: Event type discrimination works
- Ready for testing: Edit event, changes saved
- Ready for testing: Delete event, removed from Firestore
- Ready for testing: Events load and sort correctly on app start
- Ready for testing: Correct data structure in Firestore

**Deliverable:** Events fully integrated with Firestore

---

## ✅ PHASE 16 COMPLETED

**What was accomplished:**
- Created EventRepository with full Firestore CRUD operations:
  - Stores events in `projects/{projectId}/events` collection
  - `createEvent()` - Saves new events to Firestore
  - `getEventsStream()` - Real-time stream of events with automatic updates
  - `updateEvent()` - Updates existing events in Firestore
  - `deleteEvent()` - Removes events from Firestore
  - `getEvent()` - Fetches single event by ID
- Updated EventsProvider to use Firestore:
  - Converted from Notifier to AsyncNotifier for stream handling
  - Removed all mock data
  - Now subscribes to Firestore stream for real-time synchronization
  - CRUD methods delegate to repository
  - Stream subscription cleanup on dispose
  - Authentication-aware: only creates repository when user is authenticated
- Updated AssetsEventsScreen with async event state handling:
  - Added loading state with CircularProgressIndicator
  - Added error state with retry functionality
  - Data state displays events in timeline with sorting
  - Proper error handling with user feedback via SnackBars
  - Error handling in add/update/delete operations
- **Fixed Freezed nested union serialization bug:**
  - Discovered that Freezed doesn't automatically serialize nested union types (EventTiming within Event)
  - Generated `toJson()` was setting `'timing': instance.timing` instead of `'timing': instance.timing.toJson()`
  - Solution: Manual serialization in repository layer before Firestore operations
  - In `createEvent()` and `updateEvent()`, extract timing object using `event.map()` and call `timing.toJson()` explicitly
  - This pattern is necessary for nested Freezed unions with Firestore
- Freezed JSON serialization handles nested union types with manual workaround:
  - EventTiming unions (Relative/Absolute/Age) serialize correctly with manual intervention
  - Event unions (Retirement/Death/RealEstateTransaction) serialize correctly
  - No need for DTOs - Freezed generates type discrimination, but nested unions require manual serialization
- Real-time synchronization:
  - Changes to events immediately appear in UI
  - Multiple devices stay in sync
  - Stream-based architecture for live updates
  - Sorted events provider watches async events
- Code passes static analysis with no issues

**Key files created/modified:**
- lib/features/events/data/event_repository.dart - Firestore repository with CRUD operations and manual nested union serialization
- Updated lib/features/events/presentation/providers/events_provider.dart - Real-time Firestore integration with AsyncNotifier
- Updated lib/features/assets/presentation/assets_events_screen.dart - Async state handling for events tab

## Testing Workflow (Apply to Every Phase)

After completing each phase:

1. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   # or specify device:
   flutter run -d "iPhone 15 Pro"
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

2. **Manual testing:**
   - Test all new functionality
   - Try to break it (edge cases, invalid input)
   - Test on multiple screen sizes (resize window or rotate device)

3. **Verify hot reload:**
   - Make a small change
   - Press `r` to hot reload
   - Verify change appears

4. **Test on iOS specifically:**
   - Run on iOS simulator regularly
   - Check console for warnings
   - Verify no crashes

5. **Check code quality:**
   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   ```

6. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

7. **Commit working increment:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Phase X: [description]"
   ```

8. **Document any issues or technical debt**

---

## Notes

- **Incremental development** is key - each phase builds on the previous
- **Test frequently** - catch issues early when they're easier to fix
- **Use hot reload** - fastest way to see changes
- **Check iOS regularly** - CocoaPods issues should be caught early
- **Keep commits small** - easier to debug if something breaks
- **Don't skip phases** - the order is designed to minimize risk
