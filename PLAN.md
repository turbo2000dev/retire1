## PHASE 34: Dollar Toggle - Current vs Constant Dollars

**Goal:** Add toggle to view projection in current or constant dollars

### Tasks:
1. **Add dollar mode to projection calculation:**
   - [ ] Update ProjectionCalculator to accept `useConstantDollars` parameter
   - [ ] If constant dollars:
     - Divide all monetary values by (1 + inflationRate)^yearsFromStart
     - Display values in today's purchasing power
   - [ ] If current dollars:
     - Show actual nominal values (existing behavior)

2. **Add toggle to projection screen:**
   - [ ] Create toggle switch in app bar or above charts
   - [ ] "Current Dollars" / "Constant Dollars"
   - [ ] Default: Current Dollars
   - [ ] Save preference to user settings

3. **Update all visualizations:**
   - [ ] Table values adjust based on toggle
   - [ ] Chart values adjust based on toggle
   - [ ] Y-axis labels reflect dollar type
   - [ ] Add indicator "(Current $)" or "(Constant $)" to chart titles

4. **Update calculation correctly:**
   - [ ] Constant dollars only affect display
   - [ ] Underlying calculation still uses nominal values
   - [ ] Adjust values only for display purposes
   - [ ] Ensure consistency across all views

5. **Show explanation:**
   - [ ] Add info icon next to toggle
   - [ ] Explain difference between current and constant dollars
   - [ ] "Current dollars show nominal values including inflation"
   - [ ] "Constant dollars show purchasing power in today's dollars"

**Manual Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Toggle switches between current and constant dollars
- [ ] Table values update correctly
- [ ] Chart values update correctly
- [ ] Y-axis labels update
- [ ] Chart titles show dollar type
- [ ] Explanation dialog helpful
- [ ] Preference persists across sessions

**Deliverable:** Toggle to view projection in current or constant dollars

   - [ ] Green: good (money lasts, high net worth)
   - [ ] Red: warning (money runs out, low net worth)
   - [ ] Place at top of projection screen

4. **Create warnings system:**
   - [ ] Create `lib/features/projection/domain/projection_warning.dart`
   - [ ] Warning types:
     - MoneyRunsOut (year)
     - HighTaxRate (year, rate)
     - AccountDepleted (account type, year)
     - NoSurvivorIncome (year after death)
   - [ ] List of warnings per projection

5. **Display warnings:**
   - [ ] Create warnings section below KPIs
   - [ ] Show each warning with icon and description
   - [ ] Click warning to jump to year in table
   - [ ] Empty state if no warnings

6. **Create scenario comparison view:**
   - [ ] Create `lib/features/projection/presentation/scenario_comparison_screen.dart`
   - [ ] Select 2-3 scenarios to compare
   - [ ] Show KPIs side-by-side
   - [ ] Show overlaid charts
   - [ ] Highlight differences
   - [ ] Add navigation to comparison screen

7. **Update GoRouter:**
   - [ ] Add route for scenario comparison screen
   - [ ] `/projection/compare`

- [ ] KPIs calculated correctly
- [ ] KPIs displayed prominently
- [ ] Warnings detected and shown
- [ ] Click warning jumps to year
- [ ] Can compare multiple scenarios
- [ ] Comparison shows differences clearly
- [ ] Navigation to comparison works

**Deliverable:** KPIs, warnings, and scenario comparison for better decision-making

## PHASE 36: Advanced Projection Testing & Refinement

**Goal:** End-to-end testing of advanced projection calculations and polish

### Tasks:
1. **Create comprehensive test scenarios:**
   - [ ] Scenario 1: Single individual, early retirement
   - [ ] Scenario 2: Couple, both retire at 65
   - [ ] Scenario 3: One death event mid-projection
   - [ ] Scenario 4: High income with RRQ/PSV clawbacks
   - [ ] Scenario 5: Money runs out at age 80

- Phase 27: Expense calculation
- Phase 28: Tax integration
- Phase 29: Withdrawal strategy
- Phase 30: Asset balance tracking
