4. **Handle real estate as last resort:**
   - [x] If all accounts depleted and still need money:
     - [x] For Phase 31: just flag as shortfall
     - [ ] Auto-sell real estate (deferred to future phase)
     - [ ] Reverse mortgage modeling (deferred to future phase)

5. **Update projection table to show warnings:**
   - [x] Highlight years with shortfalls (light red background)
   - [x] Show shortfall amounts in dedicated column with warning icon
   - [x] Show survivor benefits with heart icon (â™¥) in Income column
   - [x] Deceased indicator removed due to bug (detecting by zero income was faulty)

- [ ] Assets transfer to survivor (deferred)
- [x] Survivor benefits calculated correctly (60% rule)
- [x] Account depletion flagged
- [x] Shortfall years highlighted
- [x] Shortfall amounts shown

**Deliverable:** Edge cases handled, warnings displayed

**Completion Notes:**
- Implemented simplified 60% survivor benefit rule (60% of deceased's RRQ + PSV)
- Death event detection in `IncomeCalculator` checks event list (not income levels)
- Modified `calculateIncome()` to accept `allIndividuals` parameter for survivor benefit calculation
- Survivor benefits stored in `AnnualIncome.other` field and displayed with heart icon
- Enhanced shortfall tracking with boolean flag and dollar amount in YearlyProjection
- Modified `_calculateCashFlowWithWithdrawals()` to return shortfall data in all return paths
- UI enhancements: light red row background for shortfall years, dedicated Shortfall column with warning icon
- Bug fix: Removed faulty deceased detection from Age column (was incorrectly flagging retired individuals with no income yet)
- Design decisions:
  - Simplified survivor benefits (no complex "higher of own or survivor" logic, no combined maximum)
  - Shortfall flagging only (no automatic real estate liquidation)
  - Asset transfers deferred to future phase (assets remain in projection after death)
- Modified files:
  - `lib/features/projection/service/income_calculator.dart` (death detection, survivor benefits)
  - `lib/features/projection/service/projection_calculator.dart` (pass events to income calculator)
  - `lib/features/projection/domain/yearly_projection.dart` (hasShortfall, shortfallAmount fields)
  - `lib/features/projection/presentation/widgets/projection_table.dart` (UI warnings)
- Ready for Phase 32 (Enhanced Projection Table)

**Completion Notes:**
- Implemented expanded projection table with ~40 columns organized into 10 column groups:
  1. Basic (Year, Age 1, Age 2)
  2. Income Sources (Employment, RRQ, PSV, RRPE, Other, Total - 6 columns)
  3. Expenses by Category (Housing, Transport, Daily Living, Recreation, Health, Family, Total - 7 columns)
  4. Taxes (Federal, Quebec, Total - 3 columns)
  5. Cash Flow (After-Tax Income, Net Cash Flow - 2 columns)
  6. Withdrawals by Account (CELI, Cash, CRI, REER, Total - 5 columns)

  8. Asset Balances End of Year (Real Estate, REER, CELI, CRI, Cash, Total Returns - 6 columns)
  9. Net Worth (Start, End - 2 columns)
  10. Warnings (Shortfall Amount - 1 column)
- Created column visibility system with local storage persistence via ColumnVisibilityProvider
- Added TabBar UI with two tabs: "Simple" (11 columns) and "Detailed" (40+ columns)
- Implemented CSV export functionality with ProjectionCsvExport service
- Added dual age columns (Age 1, Age 2) to both simple and detailed tables
- Fixed critical bug: Strikethrough for deceased individuals now shows in ALL subsequent years (not just year of death)
  - Modified `_isPrimaryDeceased` and `_isSpouseDeceased` to check cumulative death events from year 0 to current year
- Fixed critical bug: Horizontal scrolling now works correctly in both tables
  - Restructured Card layout to remove padding constraints on horizontal scroll view
  - Moved header into separate Padding with only top/side padding
  - Added `horizontalMargin: 24` to DataTable for consistent spacing
  - SingleChildScrollView placed directly under Card's Column without horizontal padding

**Files Created:**
- `lib/features/projection/presentation/widgets/expanded_projection_table.dart` (808 lines)
- `lib/features/projection/presentation/widgets/column_visibility_dialog.dart` (109 lines)
- `lib/features/projection/presentation/providers/column_visibility_provider.dart` (provider for visibility state)
- `lib/features/projection/service/projection_csv_export.dart` (222 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/features/projection/presentation/widgets/projection_table.dart` (added events/individuals parameters, fixed strikethrough, restructured Card layout)
- `lib/features/projection/presentation/projection_screen.dart` (added TabBar, providers, passed events/individuals to tables)
- `lib/features/projection/presentation/widgets/expanded_projection_table.dart` (fixed strikethrough detection)

**Design Decisions:**
- Used TabBar instead of toggle button for better visual separation between views
- Column visibility stored in local storage (not Firestore) as UI preference
- CSV export uses simplified column headers for Excel compatibility
- Strikethrough detection uses event timeline traversal (not null age checking)
- Horizontal scrolling achieved by careful layout restructuring (no padding on scroll container)
